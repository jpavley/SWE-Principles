# How to Contribute

Thanks for looking for ways to contribute to SWE-Principles, Values, Strategies! Software Engineering is a big topic and it requires a big tent to figure it out.

Like any open source project SWE-PVS requires few simple ground rules so that we can all collaborate well together. We don't want to waste anyone's time and we need your pull requests!

We're looking for contributions that improve the SWE-PVS core text. It's not code but we're treating it like code and you are welcome to contribute new _features_ (principles, new values, and new strategies) as well as point out _bugs_ (spelling, grammar, logic), and/or contribute supplementary materials (tutorials, cheat sheets, blog posts).

If you don't agree with the premise of _principles, values, and strategies_ this is **not** the place to contribute. There is obviously more than one way to engineer and software and we respect that. But here in this repo we want to explore and expand this particular path. Please feel free with fork the repo if you want to go in a different direction.

## Ground Rules

- We're writing the core text in English (but we would be happy to see it appear in other languages).
- We're formatting the core text in Markdown.
- Create issues for any major changes of enhancement you'd like to make so we can discuss
- Don't add new principles, values, and strategies to the core text unless the existing concepts can't be reasonable extended to your use-case.
- Respect the SOLID principles of OOP but applied to nonfiction writing. For example each principle should have a single responsibility. Principles should be extended by sub-principles and not become buckets of properties. Applying SOLID is a just a metaphor for clear reasoning and useful organization.
- Checkout our [code of content](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and be empathic, supportive, and welcoming.
