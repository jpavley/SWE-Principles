# SWE Foundational Principles

Since we want our software to be based on verifiable scientific principles (and not opinion--no matter how informed) we need explain which principles are we're talking about.

Software engineering is a wide field encompassing many disciplines include several of the sciences, computation, and technology business theory. We feel comfortable with the sciences but less do with business theory. Is _Moore's Law_ a principle or a value? Is the idea of _The Chasm_ that all technology product need to cross to become successful a fact of nature or a cultural phenomenon?

## Scientific Method

- Define a question
- Gather information and resources (observe)
- Form an explanatory hypothesis
- Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner
- Analyze the data
- Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis
- Publish results
- Retest (frequently done by other scientists)

## Theory of Computation

- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Theory of Computation (Universal Turing Machine)
- Information and Coding Theory
- Programming Language Theory
- Computer Architecture
- Computer Performance Analysis
- Concurrent, Parallel and Distributed Systems
- Computer Networks
- Computer Security and Cryptography
- Databases and Structured Data
- Computer Graphics and Visualization
- Humanâ€“Computer Interaction
- Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning
- Software Engineering (UNIX Philosophy)

## Theory of Technology Business

- Moore's Law
- Crossing the Chasm
- Economies of Scale
- Network Effects
