# SWE Foundational Principles

Since we want our software to be based on verifiable scientific principles (and not opinion--no matter how informed) we need explain which principles are we're talking about.

## Probability and Principles

Software engineering is a wide field encompassing many disciplines include science, computation, psychology, and business. We feel comfortable with science and computation but less do with cogitative bias and business theory. Is _Moore's Law_ a principle or a value? Is the idea of _The Chasm_ (that all technology products need to cross to become successful) a fact of nature or a cultural phenomenon?

Give our comfort/discomfort each set of principles is ranked from _likely_ to _possibly_ embodying principles.

## Statistical Significance and Principles

It is quite possible that all these so-called _principles_ are observations of statistical patterns of probability that are more stable over large numbers of events. Thus _likely principles_ deal with more numerous phenomenon than _possibly principles_ and _unlikely principles_. In a startup situation with a small number of engineers, users, and transaction, principle-based SWE strategies probably don't apply well. Intuition (a synonym for making lucky guesses) might be a better strategy for a startup than an organization interacting with hundreds or thousands of people.
