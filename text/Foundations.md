# SWE Foundational Principles

Since we want our software to be based on verifiable scientific principles (and not opinion--no matter how informed) we need explain which principles are we're talking about.

Software engineering is a wide field encompassing many disciplines include science, computation, psychology, and business. We feel comfortable with science and computation but less do with cogitative bias and business theory. Is _Moore's Law_ a principle or a value? Is the idea of _The Chasm_ (that all technology products need to cross to become successful) a fact of nature or a cultural phenomenon?

Give our comfort/discomfort each set of principles is ranked from _likely_ to _possibly_ embodying principles.

## Theory of Science (Likely Principles)

- Explanation of the natural world
- Independently Observable, Testable, and Repeatable
- Scientific Method
- Protocols of Observation
- Controlled Experiment
- Abductive Reasoning (Simplest explanation)
- Falsifiable Predictions

## Theory of Computation (Likely Principles)

- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Theory of Computation (Universal Turing Machine)
- Information and Coding Theory
- Programming Language Theory
- Computer Architecture
- Computer Performance Analysis
- Concurrent, Parallel and Distributed Systems
- Computer Networks
- Computer Security and Cryptography
- Databases and Structured Data
- Computer Graphics and Visualization
- Humanâ€“Computer Interaction
- Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning

## Theory of Cognitive Bias (Possibly Principles)

- Behavior Biases
- Social Bias
- Memory Bias

## Theory of Business (Possibly Principles)

- Moore's Law
- Crossing the Chasm
- Economies of Scale
- Network Effects
