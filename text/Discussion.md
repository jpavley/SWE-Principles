# Discussion of SWE Principles, Values, Strategies

It's common for the words _principle_, _value_, and _strategy_ to be used interchangeably but I believe each represents distinct concepts for talking about what we as humans believe to be true, how we aspire to behave, and how we put our beliefs and behaviors into action.

## Differentiating Principles, Values, Strategies

For example, that that is only one human species is a fact of science and principle the human condition. That all people are created equal endowed with "unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" is a value that we work hard to realize in our work and lives. That we have laws in place to ensure that we hold ourselves accountable to the principle of _one human species_ and the value of _unalienable right_ is strategy.

It is easy to see that verifiable scientific principles form the foundation upon which beneficial values are based and values form the foundation upon which effective strategies are based.

Values rooted in principles generally persist over time while values rooted in opinion tend to fade over time. Because we understand the principles of human biology we realize that women are the equal of men, and that we must reject the values of cultures where biological principles are not respected.

Strategies rooted in values are generally more effective over the long term than strategies rooted in happenstance. I would argue that value-less strategics are in point of fact mere tactics, effective only for a short span of time. Because we have created strategies based on beneficial values we get maximize the benefits of contributions and problem solving from all our employees, women and men, historically advantaged and disadvantaged, able-bodied and differently abled.

## Application of Principles, Values, Strategies to SWE

I think it's the same for software engineering. When our values (simplicity, agility,iteration) are based in principles (Moore's Law, UTM, Economies of Scale, and UNIX Philosophy) we get better, more reliable software strategies. When our values are based on personal opinions we get fads, failures, and make phoney progress.

I hope to be pretty rigorous about separating principles, values, and strategies from opinions, shortcuts, and tactics. There are enough statements of opinion across the Internet when it comes to software engineering. My personal opinions would just add noise to a noisy world.

Like the principles that underlie Geometry, Biology, and Physics (triangles, evolution, and gravity), software engineering _principles require observation and testing_ to be discovered and boiled down to their essence. From these verifiable principles I hope to select beneficial values that create a highly functional software engineering culture. From these utilitarian values I hope to affirm successful strategies that result in engaged engineers, great code, reliable software, and happy users.

I hope to do this for the software engineering activities that underlie infrastructure, source code, development process, logical design (architecture), software security, development culture, product design, product delivery (communication, collaboration), and management.

As these principles are discovered and not invented I hope that "I" becomes a "we" and that more software engineers just me participate in this passion project.
