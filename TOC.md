## Architecture (SOLID)

We view software architecture as a discipline of _logical design_. Our core strategy for ensuring excellence in logical design is SOLID. We believe that SOLID represents a set of software design strategies which apply to all paradigms of software development (not just OOP), especially in an agile development process context.

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

See [Architecture](text/Architecture.md)

## Code (Internal Open Source)

We have found that the benefits of open source are so superior to _closed source_ that all source code benefits by treated as open source, even if, or especially if, there is no intention of opening it to the public.

- Strict Source Code Control
- Clone for Reading
- Pull Requests for Writing
- Feature Branches
- Robust Documentation
- Shared Ownership
- Code of Conduct
- Clear Licensing
- Clear Attribution

See [Code](text/Code.md)

## Culture (Remote Only)

- No Central Location
- Flexible Work Hours (not set hours)
- Recorded Knowledge (not meetings)
- Recorded Training (no on-the-job)
- Liberal Access to Information (not need-to-know)
- Version Control (not change control)
- Asynchronous Communications
- Work/Value Measured in Results
- Formal Channels (not informal)
