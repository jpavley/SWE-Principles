## Architecture (SOLID)

We view software architecture as a discipline of _logical design_. Our core strategy for ensuring excellence in logical design is SOLID. We believe that SOLID represents a set of software design strategies which apply to all paradigms of software development (not just OOP), especially in an agile development process context.

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle
