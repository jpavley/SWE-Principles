Software Engineering Principles, Values, Strategies

## Introduction

- Software is "eating the world" and we're still not very good at software engineering
- As software has moved from dominion over "the world of bits to the world of atoms" the repercussions of hasty, thoughtless, or misguided software development and delivery has gone from crashed computers to crashed cars.
- Unfortunately, there are several impediments blocking the adoption of a software engineering ethic.
- So then, why bother?

## Discussion

- It's common for the words _principle_, _value_, and _strategy_ to be used interchangeably.
- Verifiable principles, beneficial values, effective strategies.
- When our values are based in principles we get better, more reliable software strategies.
