Software Engineering Principles, Values, Strategies

## Introduction

- Software is "eating the world" and we're still not very good at software engineering
- As software has moved from dominion over "the world of bits to the world of atoms" the repercussions of hasty, thoughtless, or misguided software development and delivery has gone from crashed computers to crashed cars.
- Unfortunately, there are several impediments blocking the adoption of a software engineering ethic.
- So then, why bother?

See [Introduction to SWE Principles, Values, Strategies](text/Introduction.md)

## Discussion

- It's common for the words _principle_, _value_, and _strategy_ to be used interchangeably.
- Verifiable principles, beneficial values, effective strategies.
- When our values are based in principles we get better, more reliable software strategies.

## Credits and Inspirations

I have to admit that this project was inspired by Ray Dalio book _Principles_, which I ran into at at an Andreessen Horowitz conference. Ray spoke at the conference and the book was handed out to the attendees for free. Ray is a controversial figure in tech and finance and I would not have read his book had I not heard him talk. It's not that I shy away from controversy, it just that I didn't understand there was a method to Ray's madness: radial transparency, hyper honesty, super open-mindedness, etc.... All potentially good strategics, mostly not _principles_. But why quibble? The idea that an summary of principles, values, and strategies that improve a profession was inspired by Ray efforts. (I'm not endorsing or criticizing Ray. I'm glad he shared his framework.)

As of this moment _SWE Principles, Values, Strategies_ is a solo effort. I'm hopeful that other experienced and thoughtful software engineering leaders will volunteer to contribute. I have many more questions than answers and I welcome all the help I can get.

Long term I hope all the "I"s in this document become "We"s.
